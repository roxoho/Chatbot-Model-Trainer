# **Project Details:** SIMPLE CHATBOT MODEL TRAINER - 
## https://simple-chatbot-trainer.streamlit.app/

### I have used Streamlit, NLTK, and Deep Learning to create a basic app where users can input the data they want to train a chatbot model on. The app then trains the model and returns it along with the necessary files to run and test the model. My goal was to make the steps simple for the user.

### You can directly use the functions in a web app.

### **Future Work:** Creating a full-fledged app for user login, data storage, model training, and chatbot component creation for external websites. The important aspect is the simplification for the user.
